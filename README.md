# Optimal-Locations-of-Vancouver-Disaster-Support-Centres


The geographical location of Vancouver and heavy rainfall in the region makes it more prone to the natural disasters like floods and earthquake. In order for aid and relief to be distributed as fast as possible, it is important to have centres, which are near the affected communities and large enough to support a large number of people. 

The goal of this project is to determine the optimal locations of disaster support centres in Vancouver in order to maximize the assistance to the affected community.
